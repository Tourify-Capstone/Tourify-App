# Mobile Development

We have dedicated ourselves to creating Tourify applications that are responsive, easy to use, and integrate seamlessly with the AI features we develop. We used Android Studio, Kotlin, and various Jetpack components like Jetpack Compose, ViewModel/LiveData, and so on to build this app.

## Development Stack for Android Application:

Below is a collection of tools, technologies, and libraries used in Android application development. These include:

### Version Control System:
- **Git/GitHub:** Manages code changes and supports collaboration in development.
### Design and Prototyping Tools:
- **Figma:** The ultimate platform for UI/UX design, prototyping, and developing consistent design patterns.
- **Canva:** Used to produce attractive visual content according to application needs.
### Development Environment:
- **Android Studio:** The ultimate development environment for writing code, designing, and debugging Android apps.
### Libraries for Android Development:
- **Glide:** Efficiently process and load images within the app.
- **Retrofit:** Facilitates communication with backend services/APIs to retrieve and display real-time data.
- **JUnit & Mockito:** Helps in unit testing and mock object management.
- **Espresso:** Performs user interaction testing to ensure proper response to user actions.
- **Android KTX:** A collection of Kotlin extensions for writing concise and expressive Kotlin code in a variety of application tasks.
### Jetpack Components:
- **ViewModel/LiveData:** Separates business logic from the user interface, presenting responsive real-time data to users.
- **Compose:** Creates a user interface declaratively.
- **Lifecycle:** Manages the life cycle of application components to ensure application behavior as expected.
- **Material Design Components:** Creates a consistent appearance following Google's Material Design principles.
- **Navigation:** Manage screen navigation in the application in an orderly and easy to understand manner.
- **Room:** Makes it easier to use SQLite databases through the concept of object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **Test:** Provides comprehensive testing tools from unit testing to user interface testing.
- **Datastore:** Stores data efficiently and replaces the use of SharedPreferences.
- **Transition:** Creates smooth transition animations between UI elements in the application.

## Usage Guide
To develop an application using this stack, follow these steps:
1. Make sure Android Studio is installed on your device.
